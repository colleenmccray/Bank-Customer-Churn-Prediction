## Context
Businesses, especially in the financial sector, face the challenge of 'Customer Churn'—customers leaving for other service providers. Understanding the factors influencing this decision is crucial for effective service improvement and customer retention.

##Objective
As a Data Scientist within the bank, your objective is to build a neural network-based classifier capable of predicting whether a customer will leave the bank within the next 6 months.

## Data Dictionary

* CustomerId: Unique ID assigned to each customer
* Surname: Last name of the customer

* Exited: Binary variable indicating whether the customer left the bank within six months (0=No, 1=Yes)

## Actionable Insights and Recommendations

### Recommendations
**1. Investigate High NumOfProducts Churn:**
* Conduct research to understand why customers with a larger number of products tend to exit.
* Address any underlying issues within customer service or product satisfaction that may contribute to churn in this segment.
  
**2. Increase Marketing/Customer Support in Germany:**
* Intensify marketing and customer support efforts in Germany, aiming to support customers who may be considering exiting.
* Tailor strategies to the specific needs and preferences of the German customer base.

**3. Promote Active Membership:**
